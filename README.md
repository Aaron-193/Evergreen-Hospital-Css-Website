## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the site locally:

'''bash'''

git clone https://github.com/Aaron-193/Evergreen-HospitalCss-Website.git


cd Evergreen-HospitalCss-Website


Then open index.html in your browser. No build tools or backend required.


## 🛠 Customisation
- Doctor Profiles – update images and bios in /img/doctors/ and index.html
- Map Location – replace the embedded iframe with your clinic’s Google Maps link
- Fonts – swap Google Fonts in the <head> for a different tone
- Colours – adjust Bootstrap variables or custom styles in style.css

💬 Why This Exists
I built this as a lightweight, front-end-only solution for healthcare providers who need a clean online presence. It’s easy to customise, quick to deploy, and designed with real users in mind — especially patients who just want clarity and trust.
